<p class="lead">We’re pleased to announce that Pashen Bars are launching an updated size, packaging, and lower retail price!  We’ve been working hard on this update over the last few months, and a lot of thought and planning has gone into this change.  </p>

<p class="lead">New Benefits to you:</p>

<ul>
	<li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>Retail price lowered from $3.99 to $2.99/bar!  Horray!  </li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>New, easy-to-open, fin seal packaging -  Let’s face it; the old bars were so  hard to open.  You can put that scissors away for good as our new bag has notches that make it super easy to open.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>Slightly smaller, but perfect snack size.  Same great flavor, taste and quality ingredients</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>New look for our Original flavor bar, allowing for easier differentiation between the flavors.  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="lead">Our goal with the product and packaging changes is to maintain an exceptional degree of quality while also making Pashen Bars more affordable to you!</p>

<p class="lead">Thank you for your continued support and help as we transition.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
